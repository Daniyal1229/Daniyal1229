     <h1>   Hi there, I'm Syed Daniyal Bokhari! ðŸ‘‹ </h1>
        I am a Software Engineering Student at Ghousia College with a keen interest in data science and machine learning.
        <br>
        This is my personal repository, where I share my projects and code related to data science.
        <br>

       <h2>  Projects </h2>
        Here are some of the projects I have worked on:
        <br>
      <b>   Book Registration Form Using Servlets </b>
      <br>
        The Book Registration Form is a database-driven online application that stores and manages information about books. It is designed with a blend of client-side front-end technologies such as HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap and server-side Java Servlet. The information is saved in a MySQL database that is controlled by a Tomcat server.
        <br>
      <b>  Employee Record Management System </b> 
      <br>
        Employee Record Management System (ERMS) is a web-based programme that is used to handle personnel data in a company. It enables users to save, retrieve, and update employee information such as personal information, work information, and other pertinent data. HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and PHP are used to create the system. To produce an intuitive user experience, the frontend is built with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. The application's functionality is built with JavaScript, which gives users with a dynamic and interactive experience. The application's backend is written in PHP, which allows it to store, retrieve, and update employee data in a database. MySQL, a relational database management system, is used to construct the database.
        <br>
      <b>  AI Virtual Mouse </b> 
      <br>
        An AI Virtual Mouse with Hand movements is a novel programme that enables users to control the computer mouse cursor with hand movements. It was created with the Python, OpenCV, Mediapipe, and Pyautogui packages. The application tracks the user's hand motions and converts them into mouse cursor movements using the computer's camera. For computer vision, the OpenCV library is utilised, allowing the programme to recognise and track the user's hand in real-time. The Mediapipe library includes machine learning models that have been pre-trained to identify and recognise hand gestures. The Pyautogui package simulates mouse clicks, allowing users to interact with computers through hand gestures. The application also includes a number of hand gestures that may be used to perform various mouse actions.
        <br>
      <b>   Data Analysis </b>
      <br>
        The zombie virus data analysis project seeks to investigate and analyse a particular dataset in order to acquire insight into the virus's features and propagation. Data cleansing, exploration, and visualisation are all part of the analysis to uncover patterns and trends in the data. The study also includes statistical modelling to investigate the correlations between various variables and estimate the virus's possible impact. The findings of the study can be utilised to drive policy choices and public health measures aimed at slowing the spread and impact of the zombie virus.
